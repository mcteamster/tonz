                    Games and media have the power to captivate audiences on an 
                    incomparable scale - and this will never cease to amaze me. 
                    <br><br>
                    As a kid I would dream up endless inventions and ideas. Yet I 
                    never had the resources nor the patience to put pen to paper.
                    So instead I taught myself how to mock-up concepts and rapid 
                    prototypes with whatever I had at my disposal - i.e. Microsoft Office.
                    <br><br>
                    Now in the age of apps anything is possible. But old habits die 
                    hard - Office undeniably still makes the world go round. So here 
                    I've used PowerPoint and Excel as development platforms, and a 
                    little creativity, to showcase just what you can do...

                    <i> for PowerPoint 2010 Desktop or Later</i>
                    <br><br>
                    A side-on survival shooter inspired by Flash games of the 2000s,
                    this game brings new meaning to the phrase "Death By PowerPoint".
                    <br><br>
                    Wave Defence utilises PowerPoint's native vector graphics
                    for design, and Custom Animation for high-level What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get 
                    programming. Hyperlinks, Triggers, and Custom Shows
                    complete the presentation's interactive functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    This game comes in two versions, Standard and Hard Mode. Hard Mode
                    adds more weapons, and limited ammunition for anyone looking for 
                    a tougher challenge.

                    A take on the classic Windows game from a simpler time.
                    <br><br>
                    Minesweeper was originally included with Windows 3.1 to teach users how to 
                    Right-Click, but was removed in 2012 with the release of Windows 8. 
                    Now you can relive the nostalgia with the power of Excel! 
                    <br><br>
                    The game is reverse-engineered from countless hours of playing
                    Windows Minesweeper. Excel's inherent grid layout helps to visualise the
                    board in development, with VBA Macros, Spreadsheet Functions, and 
                    Conditional Formatting holding the pieces together underneath.

                    Tilt the tiles with the arrow keys, or "WASD". When equal tiles collide they 
                    merge - try to reach 2048 or beyond! Start a new game by pressing "N" or "Enter".

                    Programmed in a week during my internship to teach myself Visual Basic 
                    for Applications (VBA). I was pleasantly surprised by how well 2048 runs, 
                    considering my grossly unoptimised code.
