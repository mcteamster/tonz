                <br>
                <p> 
                    I have always been captivated by interactive content. 
                    To me it is the way that media and games invoke widespread 
                    emotion that is so alluringly inspirational.
                    <br><br>
                    For a long time my imagination was bound only by my tools 
                    and ability. Yet this challenge taught me how to harness my
                    resources to transform ideas into reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Microsoft Office may seem mundane and misplaced in an age
                    dominated by apps and the web. But the inescapable truth is 
                    that it makes the world go round. Here I've developed a 
                    selection of games to showcase just some of the things you 
                    can do with merely PowerPoint and Excel.

                    A side-on survival shooter inspired by Flash games of the 2000s,
                    this game brings new meaning to the phrase "Death By PowerPoint".
                    <br><br>
                    Wave Defence utilises PowerPoint's native vector graphics
                    for design, and Custom Animation for high-level What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get 
                    programming. Hyperlinks, Triggers, and Custom Shows
                    complete the presentation's interactive functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    This game comes in two versions, Standard and Hard Mode. Hard Mode
                    adds more weapons, and limited ammunition for anyone looking for 
                    a tougher challenge.

                    A take on the classic Windows game from a simpler time.
                    <br><br>
                    Minesweeper was originally included with Windows 3.1 to teach users how to 
                    Right-Click, and came with all versions until the release of Windows 8 in 2012. 
                    Now you can relive the nostalgia with the power of Excel! 
                    <br><br>
                    This whole game is reverse-engineered from countless hours of playing
                    Windows Minesweeper. Excel's inherent grid layout helps to visualise the
                    board in development, with VBA Macros, Spreadsheet Functions, and 
                    Conditional Formatting holding the pieces together underneath.

                    Tilt the tiles with the arrow keys, or "WASD". When equal tiles collide they 
                    merge - try to reach 2048 or beyond! Start a new game by pressing "N" or "Enter". 
                    <br><br>
                    Programmed in a week during my internship to teach myself Visual Basic 
                    for Applications. 2048 runs surprisingly well in Excel despite my grossly 
                    unoptimised code.
