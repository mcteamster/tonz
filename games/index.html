                    I have always been fascinated by interactive content. 
                    Games and media are able to captivate audiences in ways
                    I find simply inspirational.
                    <br><br>
                    Growing up with limited skills and resources, I found it
                    hard to keep up with my imagination. Despite the circumstances,
                    through patience and resilience, I learnt how to harness whatever 
                    tools I had at my disposal.

                    Microsoft Office may seem outdated in the age of apps, but you
                    can't escape the fact that it makes the world go round. 
                    Here I've chosen PowerPoint and Excel as game development platforms
                    to showcase capabilities you might not have known were possible...

                    A side-on survival shooter inspired by Flash games of the 2000s,
                    this game brings new meaning to the phrase "Death By PowerPoint".
                    <br><br>
                    Wave Defence utilises PowerPoint's native vector graphics
                    for design, and Custom Animation for high-level What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get 
                    programming. Hyperlinks, Triggers, and Custom Shows
                    complete the presentation's interactive functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    This game comes in two versions, Standard and Hard Mode. Hard Mode
                    adds more weapons, and limited ammunition for anyone looking for 
                    a tougher challenge.

                    A take on the classic Windows game from a simpler time.
                    <br><br>
                    Minesweeper was originally included with Windows 3.1 to teach users how to 
                    Right-Click, but was removed in 2012 with the release of Windows 8. 
                    Now you can relive the nostalgia with the power of Excel! 
                    <br><br>
                    The game is reverse-engineered from countless hours of playing
                    Windows Minesweeper. Excel's inherent grid layout helps to visualise the
                    board in development, with VBA Macros, Spreadsheet Functions, and 
                    Conditional Formatting holding the pieces together underneath.

                    Tilt the tiles with the arrow keys, or "WASD". When equal tiles collide they 
                    merge - try to reach 2048 or beyond! Start a new game by pressing "N" or "Enter".

                    Programmed in a week during my internship to teach myself Visual Basic 
                    for Applications (VBA). I was pleasantly surprised by how well 2048 runs, 
                    considering my grossly unoptimised code.
