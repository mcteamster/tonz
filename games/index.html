                <br>
                <p> 
                    I have always been captivated by interactive content. 
                    To me it is the way that media and games invoke widespread 
                    emotion that is so alluringly inspirational.
                    <br><br>
                    For a long time my imagination was bound only by my tools 
                    and ability. Yet this challenge taught me how to harness my
                    resources to transform ideas into reality.
                    <br><br>
                    Microsoft Office may seem mundane and misplaced in an age
                    dominated by apps and the web. But the inescapable truth is 
                    that it makes the world go round. Here I've developed a 
                    selection of games to showcase just some of the things you 
                    can do with merely PowerPoint and Excel.
                </p>

                    <br><br>
                    A side-on survival shooter inspired by Flash games of the 2000s,
                    this game brings new meaning to the phrase "Death By PowerPoint".
                    <br><br>
                    Wave Defence utilises PowerPoint's intuitive native vector graphics
                    for design, and Custom Animation for What-You-See-Is-What-You-Get 
                    high-level programming. Hyperlinks, Triggers, and Custom Shows
                    complete the presentation's interactive functionality.
                    <br><br>
                    This game comes in two versions, Standard and Hard Mode. Hard Mode
                    adds more weapons, and limited ammunition for anyone looking for 
                    a tougher challenge.
