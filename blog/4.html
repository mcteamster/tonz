      <h2> or the paradox of productivity </h2>

          Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (<u>Arthur C. Clarke, 1968</u>); and

        These two concepts altered my brain chemistry. 
        Whilst Clarke's law is in reference to science fiction, I often see it hold true in everyday trials.
        As I approach 10 years in the tech industry, bridging the gap between technology and humanity, 
        I can't help but feel a sense of mystic wonder towards this beautiful game of life.
        <br><br>
        I've written this piece as a reflection on my career and my 20s; with the lessons I learned along the way.
        And of course, this wouldn't be one of my blogs without a companion story.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~In a faraway land~</span><br>
        The <i>Emperor</i> lay his head in his hands as he cast his eyes over the war room table. 
        <br><br>
        Invaders to the North, pirates in the West Sea, revolts in the Eastern Provinces, and famine in the South.
        <br><br>
        For decades had the Empire been in steady decline, losing land, wealth, and influence to the nations at its borders.
        Long gone were the golden days of plenty the Emperor had enjoyed as a young prince, replaced only by suffering and strife.
        <br><br>
        To make matters worse the Emperor suspected dissidents within his ranks.
        The military commanders who had served his father in the wars of conquest, had all succumbed shortly before the Emperor acceded the throne. 
        The constant influx of new blood left him uneasy. Tension bubbled and sparks would flew at every counsel meeting.
        <br><br>
        You see, in the Empire, magic was restricted to state use only.
        The sorcerers who drove the revolution that ushered in the golden era were appointed to the ministry
        - both to serve their country, and to control them.
        Today, many of the highly commissioned officers were made up of second and third generation magic-users.
        <br><br>
        However, over time the Empire's enemeies also grew wiser and more resourceful.
        They learned to live with, counteract, and even benefit from the fearsome sorcery.
        Their change in tactics had emboldened their transgressions and threatened the Emperor's claim to power.
        <br><br>
        Desperate times called for desperate measures.
        <br><br>
        It was customary for the Emperor to not be involved in daily governing affiars, and he preferred it that way.
        Alas the situation had reached the point of intervention.
        His presence at the war council was enough to strike fear into even the most senior statesmen.
        Letting out a sigh of exasperation, he issued a command to the room.
        <br><br>
        "What ever you have been doing is clearly not working. I grant you each a single audience to offer me a solution. Behave like your life depends on it."
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Sorcerer's Solution~</span><br>
        <i>A sorcerer is a magic-user whose power is granted innately, usually hereditary. Brilliant sorcerers are exceptionally rare and most require practice to hone their talent.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>The Grand Sorcerer</i> propopsed focusing development into a <i>New</i> experimental field of magic, on the promise that it would revolutionise both military and industrial might.
        <br><br>
        There were very few sorcerers born with the 'gift' of this affinity, most of whom were already sequestered by the state for other duties.
        The lack of understanding in this field had been the by-product of competing priorities and its inherent complexity.
        Even the basic comprehension of this kind of magic relies heavily on the mastery of many others, taking years to accomplish.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor covertly reassigned most state sorcerers to the research project, leaving operations primarily in the hands of the civil administrators.
        In the public eye the mages simply vanished overnight, fuelling conspiracies and sentiments of abandonment.
        <br><br>
        The research however, showed remarkable progress. Within a year the sorcerers made several breakthroughs that brought the arcane magic closer to practicality.
        As development ramped up and morale wore thin, it became harder and harder for the state to hide the program.
        And so, the Emperor ordered the sorcerers to launch a demonstration of progress to keep the public at bay.
        <br><br>
        The frontline of the northern border war had been steadily encroaching. 
        With the faltering support of the country's agriculture and industry, the northern defenders ceded city after city.
        But according to the Emperor - this was all going to change.
        <br><br>
        In the dead of night the sorcerers launched the a devastaing counterattack in the occupied zone.
        <br><br>
        It went as quickly as it came, and all that lay waste was destruction and death.
        <br><br>
        The northern invaders, scattered and shattered by the unprecedented force, fled rapidly.
        Word spread quickly about the New Magic's power of obliteration throughout all the lands.
        <br><br>
        Back in the capital, the Emperor prepared for a victory speech - hailing the sorcerers as saviours.
        Yet when the time came, his words rang out empty over the crowd.
        <br><br>
        There were no cheers, just stunned silence. A silence that slowly turned to frustration, a frustration that turned to disgust, and a disgust that turned to fury.
        <br><br>
        The people harboured feelings of disdain towards the Emperor and his neglect of their real problems.
        Whist the New Magic had both the ability to create AND destroy, that was wholly unclear to the citizens who only saw it as a far fetched distraction from reality.
        The Emperor's tone deaf action of scorching the earth in their own annexed northern province was aptly echoed in the court of public opinion.
        <br><br>
        Despite the unbound theoretical potential of the New Magic, nothing could save the Emperor from his own blindsightedness and mismanagement.
        <br><br>
        Without trust in the state, the nation plunged into disarray.
        The provinces rebelled, and either declared independence or seceded to join neighbouring countries.
        Yet noone dared tried to overthrow the Emperor directly from the fear of the unknown consequences of the New Magic.
        <br><br>
        Soon the Empire became a husk of its former glory.
        Without the same chokehold grip the state had on the sorcerers, many fled or were captured.
        Although ironically, the sorcerers themselves had little interest in politics.
        They happily continued developing the New Magic across the New World.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Wizard's Wish~</span><br>
        A wizard is a magic-user whose power is learned through practice and study. They may have some innate capability or it can be entirely taught.

        The Arch Wizard suggest opening the school of magic to the masses to mobilise conscripts and prepare the general populace for self-defence.
        The quality of eduction is imperfect and fiedlity to the original art is lost.
        Soon, a large number of people know how to use basic magic but lack the undeamental understanidng behind it.

        Through sheer numbers the nation is able to defend itself from invaders and famine. The revolt is suppressed but the piracy intensifies.

        magic soon becomes a commodity skills - that lowers its relative power and advantage. 
        Gradually this power continues to dissipates beyond the borders of the empire.
        It is improved and refined, only to be used against them

        The Empire became complacent in delegating the responsibility for magic out freely after the war without coordination or further research and development.

        The Emperor lives long enough to abdicate the throne to his son - but eventually the son faces the same problems with revolt and piracy, and no solutions.

        Easier to delegate the "what" instead of fixing the problem at the source.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Warlock's Wargame~</span><br>
        A warlock is a magic-user whose power is granted by a higher-power. This requires some kind of sacrifice or deal, and can be done by anyone - innately magical or not.

        The Chief Warlock practices the religion of the Old Gods - which has been outlawed for centuries. 
        This kind of magic gains power from the number of people who feed it.
        He suggests repealing the laws suppressing pracice of the Old Religion and opening patronage to the masses.
        The Warlock communions with his patron and negotiates the price of patronage to simply be blind accetpance.( of the terms and conditions)

        The citizens flock to the old religion like moths to a lightbulb, drawn by its promise of easy solutions and seemingly low price.
        Crop yields improve, the revolts are suppressed - the army and navy find the strength to smike and keep the invaders and pirates away.

        Eventually the Old Religion spreads far into the world like wildfire, and the capital becomes a holy city.
        The Emperor is annointed as a saint and give the mandate to rule in the eyes of the god.
        It starts to encounter other, conflicing religions that challenge its existence.
        The nation gets pulled into holy wars far from its own borders born to protect its interests in its Religion.

        The population is one that does not understand the magic it relies on to live everyday, but accepts it willingly.
        Life becomes unimaginable without the gods.

        But god giveth and god taketh away. Without free will the population is at the mercy of the religion, who also have a chokehold on the Throne.
        The Warlocks gradually become the clandestine ruling class with the Emperor just a puppet.

        the emperor lays his head in his hands and weeps, as he understands why the old religion was outlawed so long ago.

        e.g. AI, big Tech, social media, religion
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~Intermission~</span><br>
        The sorcerers are intensely and want to improve magic.
        The wizards are educated and want to spread magic.
        The warlocks are ambitious and want to control with magic.

        If left unchecked each faction will spell the doom of the empire, its citizens, itself or all of the above.
        The solution lies in keeping all three forever in a tug-of-war with each other.
        Each faction complements and counterbalances the others
        + Sorcerers innovate (counters stagnation and dominance)
        + Wizards evangalise (counters scepticism and deception)
        + Warlocks capitalise (counters slowness and complacency)

        Sorcery:
        Easier to build greenfields instead of fixing the problem at the source.
        First mover's disadvantage.
        A.k.A Space Race? Solar? Nuclear?

        The Emperor's folly is that he doesn't understand magic and the interpolitics of his advisors. 
        He sits in an ivory tower and thinks one dimensionally that picking a single horse can win the race.
        Rather, it's only when the horses work together can they pull the carriage - and he needs to be the one in the drivers seat.

        Allegory
        Invaders = Defence issues
        Pirates = Trade issues
        Revolts = Civil issues
        Famine = Industrial issues

        Wizard = Learned power, education and empowerment
        Warlock = Patronised power, deal with the devil. AI big tech
        Sorcerer = Innate power, science - privelege
        
        The solution is for them all to work together, not necessarily in harmony but in a balanced tug-of-war
        The sum of the parts is greater than it all. You can have a win-win-win situation.

        <br><br>
        Parallels between work and romance? Perhaps there's something instinctual that drives us to seek more.

        Acceping the status quo, and taking it for granted is like a union - a harmonious matrimony of both parties.

        Losing it is like a divorce, sometimes othertimes brutally

                They say people overestimate what they can accomplish in one year, but underestimate what they can do in ten.
        Finally I can say I have the data to truly agree.
