        These two concepts altered my brain chemistry. 
        Whilst Clarke's law is in reference to science fiction, I often see it hold true in everyday trials.
        As I approach 10 years in the tech industry, bridging the gap between technology and humanity, 
        I can't help but feel a sense of mystic wonder towards this beautiful game of life.
        <br><br>
        I've written this piece as a reflection on my career and my 20s; with the lessons I learned along the way.
        And of course, this wouldn't be one of my blogs without a companion story.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~In a faraway land~</span><br>
        The <i>Emperor</i> lay his head in his hands as he cast his eyes over the war room table. 
        <br><br>
        Invaders to the North, pirates in the West Sea, revolts in the Eastern Provinces, and famine in the South.
        <br><br>
        For decades had the Empire been in steady decline, losing land, wealth, and influence to the nations at its borders.
        Long gone were the golden days of plenty the Emperor had enjoyed as a young prince, replaced only by suffering and strife.
        <br><br>
        To make matters worse the Emperor suspected dissidents within his ranks.
        The military commanders who had served his father in the wars of conquest, had all succumbed shortly before the Emperor acceded the throne. 
        The constant influx of new blood left him uneasy. Tension bubbled and sparks would flew at every counsel meeting.
        <br><br>
        You see, in the Empire, magic was restricted to state use only.
        The sorcerers who invented the revolutionary weapons that ushered in the golden era were appointed to the ministry
        - both to serve their country, and to control them.
        Today, many of the commissioned officers were made up of second and third generation magic-users.
        <br><br>
        However, over time the Empire's enemeies also grew wiser and more resourceful.
        They learned to live with, counteract, and even benefit from the fearsome sorcery.
        Their change in tactics had emboldened their transgressions and threatened the Emperor's claim to power.
        <br><br>
        Desperate times called for desperate measures.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor preferred not to be involved in daily governing affiars but the situation had reached the point of action.
        His presence at the war council was enough to strike fear into even the most senior statesmen.
        He let out a sigh of exasperation, and issued a command to the room.
        <br><br>
        "What ever you have been doing is clearly not working. I grant each one of you a single audience to offer me a solution. Behave like your life depends on it."
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Sorcerer's Solution~</span><br>
        A sorcerer is a magic-user whose power is granted innately, usually hereditary. Brilliant sorcerers are exceptionally rare and most require practice to master their art.

        The Sorcerer propopses a plan to develop a new experimental field of magic.
        It shows promising returns and has the potential to revolutionise the military and civil industries once again.

        The sorcerers spend years researching this new magic, all while the existing problem at hand continues to grow worse.
        Land is annexed, trade is plundered and starvation is rampant. All of which fuels revolt that spreads throughout the nation.
        
        Eventually the new magic is stable and ready - and rapidly improving.
        but all the commoners see is a far fetched distraction from their daily struggles.
        The citizens either cannot comprehend the magnitude of the new magic's improvement, nor do they trust the imperial sorcerers.

        This results in a revolution where the monarchy is overthrown and the nation is plunged into anarchy.
        The provinces either declare independence or are annexed.
        The sorcerers flee or are captured, and made to work on the new magic for their previous adversaries.
        
        Easier to build greenfields instead of fixing the problem at the source.

        A.k.A Space Race? Solar? Nuclear?

        <span class="branch">~The Wizard's Wish~</span><br>
        A wizard is a magic-user whose power is learned through practice and study. They may have some innate capability or it can be entirely taught.

        The Wizard suggest opening the school of magic to the masses to mobilise conscripts and prepare the general populace for self-defence.
        The quality of eduction is imperfect and fiedlity to the original art is lost.
        Soon, a large number of people know how to use basic magic but lack the undeamental understanidng behind it.

        Through sheer numbers the nation is able to defend itself from invaders and famine. The revolt is suppressed but the piracy intensifies.

        magic soon becomes a commodity skills - that lowers its relative power and advantage. 
        Gradually this power continues to dissipates beyond the borders of the empire.
        It is improved and refined, only to be used against them

        The Empire became complacent in delegating the responsibility for magic out freely after the war without coordination or further research and development.

        The Emperor lives long enough to abdicate the throne to his son - but eventually the son faces the same problems with revolt and piracy, and no solutions.

        Easier to delegate the "what" instead of fixing the problem at the source.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Warlock's Wargame~</span><br>
        A warlock is a magic-user whose power is granted by a higher-power. This requires some kind of sacrifice or deal, and can be done by anyone - innately magical or not.

        The Warlock practices the religion of the Old Gods - which has been outlawed for centuries. 
        This kind of magic gains power from the number of people who feed it.
        He suggests repealing the laws suppressing pracice of the Old Religion and opening patronage to the masses.
        The Warlock communions with his patron and negotiates the price of patronage to simply be blind accetpance.( of the terms and conditions)

        The citizens flock to the old religion like moths to a lightbulb, drawn by its promise of easy solutions and seemingly low price.
        Crop yields improve, the revolts are suppressed - the army and navy find the strength to smike and keep the invaders and pirates away.

        Eventually the Old Religion spreads far into the world like wildfire, and the capital becomes a holy city.
        The Emperor is annointed as a saint and give the mandate to rule in the eyes of the god.
        It starts to encounter other, conflicing religions that challenge its existence.
        The nation gets pulled into holy wars far from its own borders born to protect its interests in its Religion.

        The population is one that does not understand the magic it relies on to live everyday, but accepts it willingly.
        Life becomes unimaginable without the gods.

        But god giveth and god taketh away. Without free will the population is at the mercy of the religion, who also have a chokehold on the Throne.
        The Warlocks gradually become the clandestine ruling class with the Emperor just a puppet.

        the emperor lays his head in his hands and weeps, as he understands why the old religion was outlawed so long ago.

        e.g. AI, big Tech, social media, religion
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~Intermission~</span><br>
        The sorcerers are intensely and want to improve magic.
        The wizards are educated and want to spread magic.
        The warlocks are ambitious and want to control with magic.

        If left unchecked each faction will spell the doom of the empire, its citizens, itself or all of the above.
        The solution lies in keeping all three forever in a tug-of-war with each other.
        Each faction complements and counterbalances the others
        + Sorcerers innovate (counters stagnation and dominance)
        + Wizards evangalise (counters scepticism and deception)
        + Warlocks capitalise (counters slowness and complacency)

        Allegory
        Invaders = Defence issues
        Pirates = Trade issues
        Revolts = Civil issues
        Famine = Industrial issues

        Wizard = Learned power, education and empowerment
        Warlock = Patronised power, deal with the devil. AI big tech
        Sorcerer = Innate power, science - privelege
        
        The solution is for them all to work together, not necessarily in harmony but in a balanced tug-of-war
        The sum of the parts is greater than it all. You can have a win-win-win situation.

        Parallels between work and romance? Perhaps there's something instinctual that drives us to seek more.

        Acceping the status quo, and taking it for granted is like a union - a harmonious matrimony of both parties.

        Losing it is like a divorce, sometimes othertimes brutally

                They say people overestimate what they can accomplish in one year, but underestimate what they can do in ten.
        Finally I can say I have the data to truly agree.
