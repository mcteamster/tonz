      <h2> or the paradox of productivity </h2>

        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clarke%27s_three_laws" target="_blank">
          Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic (<u>Arthur C. Clarke, 1968</u>); and

        <br><br>
        These two concepts altered my brain chemistry. 
        Although Clarke's law is in reference to science fiction, I see it apply everyday when bridging the gap between technology and humanity.
        As I approach 10 years in the tech industry I still can't help but feel a sense of mystic wonder - one which may never fade.
        <br><br>
        I've written this piece as a reflection on my career and my 20s; with the lessons I learned along the way.
        And of course, this wouldn't be one of my blogs without a companion story.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~In a faraway land~</span><br>
        The <i>Emperor</i> lay his head in his hands as he cast his eyes over the war room table. 
        <br><br>
        Invaders to the North, pirates in the West Sea, revolts in the Eastern Provinces, and famine in the South.
        <br><br>
        For decades had the Empire been in steady decline, losing land, wealth, and influence to the nations at its borders.
        Long gone were the golden days of plenty the Emperor had enjoyed as a young prince, replaced only by suffering and strife.
        <br><br>
        To make matters worse the Emperor suspected dissidents within his ranks.
        The military commanders who had served his father in the wars of conquest, had all succumbed shortly before the Emperor acceded the throne. 
        The constant influx of new blood left him uneasy. Tension bubbled and sparks would flew at every counsel meeting.
        <br><br>
        You see, in the Empire, magic was restricted to state use only.
        The sorcerers who drove the revolution that ushered in the golden era were appointed to the ministry
        - both to serve their country, and to control them.
        Today, many of the highly commissioned officers were made up of second and third generation magic-users.
        <br><br>
        However, over time the Empire's enemeies also grew wiser and more resourceful.
        They learned to live with, counteract, and even benefit from the fearsome sorcery.
        Their change in tactics had emboldened their transgressions and threatened the Emperor's claim to power.
        <br><br>
        Desperate times called for desperate measures.
        <br><br>
        It was customary for the Emperor to not be involved in daily governing affiars, and he preferred it that way.
        Alas the situation had reached the point of intervention.
        His presence at the war council was enough to strike fear into even the most senior statesmen.
        Letting out a sigh of exasperation, he issued a command to the room.
        <br><br>
        "This council is clearly not working well together. You shall each give me a single plan, and I shall choose. Behave like your life depends on it."
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Sorcerer's Solution~</span><br>
        <i>A sorcerer is a magic-user whose power is granted innately, usually hereditary. Brilliant sorcerers are exceptionally rare and most require practice to hone their talent.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>The Grand Sorcerer</i> propopsed focusing development into a <i>New</i> experimental field of magic, on the promise that it would revolutionise both military and industrial might.
        <br><br>
        There were very few sorcerers born with the 'gift' of this affinity, most of whom were already sequestered by the state for other duties.
        The lack of understanding in this field had been the by-product of competing priorities and its inherent complexity.
        Even the basic comprehension of this kind of magic relies heavily on the mastery of many others, taking years to accomplish.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor covertly reassigned most state sorcerers to the research project, leaving operations primarily in the hands of the civil administrators.
        In the public eye the mages simply vanished overnight, fuelling conspiracies and sentiments of abandonment.
        <br><br>
        The research however, showed remarkable progress. Within a year the sorcerers made several breakthroughs that brought the arcane magic closer to practicality.
        As development ramped up and morale wore thin, it became harder and harder for the state to hide the program.
        And so, the Emperor ordered the sorcerers to launch a demonstration of progress to keep the public at bay.
        <br><br>
        The frontline of the Northern border war had been steadily encroaching. 
        With the faltering support of the country's agriculture and industry, the Northern defenders ceded city after city.
        But according to the Emperor - this was all going to change.
        <br><br>
        In the dead of night the sorcerers launched the a devastaing counterattack in the occupied zone.
        <br><br>
        It went as quickly as it came, and all that lay waste was destruction and death.
        <br><br>
        The Northern invaders, scattered and shattered by the unprecedented force, fled rapidly.
        Word spread quickly about the New Magic's power of obliteration throughout all the lands.
        <br><br>
        Back in the capital, the Emperor prepared for a victory speech - hailing the sorcerers as saviours.
        Yet when the time came, his words rang out empty over the crowd.
        <br><br>
        There were no cheers, just stunned silence. A silence that slowly turned to frustration, a frustration that turned to disgust, and a disgust that turned to fury.
        <br><br>
        The people harboured feelings of disdain towards the Emperor and his neglect of their real problems.
        Whist the New Magic had both the ability to create AND destroy, that was wholly unclear to the citizens who only saw it as a far fetched distraction from reality.
        The Emperor's tone deaf action of scorching the earth in their own annexed Northern province was aptly echoed in the court of public opinion.
        <br><br>
        Despite the unbound theoretical potential of the New Magic, nothing could save the Emperor from his own blindsightedness and mismanagement.
        <br><br>
        Without trust in the state, the nation plunged into disarray.
        The provinces rebelled, and either declared independence or seceded to join neighbouring countries.
        Although no one dared tried to overthrow the Emperor directly from the fear of the unknown consequences of the New Magic.
        <br><br>
        Soon the Empire became a husk of its former glory.
        Without the same chokehold grip the state had on the sorcerers, many fled or were captured.
        Although ironically, the sorcerers themselves had little interest in politics.
        They happily continued developing the New Magic across the New World.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Wizard's Wish~</span><br>
        <i>A wizard is a magic-user whose power is learned through practice and study. They may have some innate capability or be entirely taught, but are limited to the sophistication of the literature.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>The Arch Wizard</i> suggested opening the school of magic to the masses. 
        This would allow the Empire to mobilise conscripts and train reservists for self-defence.
        His calculations also showed the peacetime benefits of magical training would help to improve productivity and loyalty to the crown.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor consented, and soon enacted two decrees. The former offering basic magical education for all citizens.
        The latter mandating military service for all <i>able-minded</i> men of age.
        <br><br>
        Given the previously reserved prestige and status associated with sorcery, many peasants leapt at the opportunity that magic could afford them.
        On the other hand, the middle-classes were coerced to enlist more due to the relatively preferential treatment that the mage-corps were afforded.
        Whatever the reason, people signed up in droves for magic classes, eager to get ahead.
        <br><br>
        This rapid shift in policy quickly strained the existing wizardry acadamies beyond capacity.
        Mages from across the Empire were diverted to fulfil the Emperor's decrees.
        The senior sorcerers, wizards, and warlocks were tasked with military training and higher education in the cities,
        whereas the apprentices were sent to set up new schools in the provinces.
        <br><br>
        The benefits of the Open Magic Program were felt within the year. 
        Magical literacy skyrocketed tenfold, and the military bolstered its numbers to follow suit.
        Through sheer numbers and determination the newly empowered populace drove back the Northern invasion and turned their eyes to the Western Seas.
        <br><br>
        Armed with the ability to defend themselves independently of the navy, the sailors and traders stood a chance against the pirates.
        The amount of lost cargoes reduced significantly, as the pirates diverted their attention to other, more vulnerable nations.
        <br><br>
        All the while, the rebellion in the East lost momentum organically.
        With a sense of hope and promises of prosperity the people of the East no longer felt overlooked by the Empire.
        The workers of the East began to band together and form guilds of magecraft to further share magic amongst their people.
        <br><br>
        However, not everything was perfect.
        The famine in the heartland of the South had been staved off by imports from the reinvigorated other regions.
        But the poor harvests and increased shortage of peasant labour condemned the farms to a slow and steady decline...
        <br><br>
        Twenty years after the Emperor's decrees the Arch Wizard declared the Open Magic Program to be a resounding success.
        Once a rare sight on the streets of the city, magic was now ubiquitous - but most importantly it was <i>accepted.</i>
        <br><br>
        But perhaps this very acceptence was to become its downfall.
        <br><br>
        As time went on, magic not only spread, but it became <i>needed</i>.
        As a common skill the bar was raised for opportunities that would have previously been granted on a silver platter.
        A citizen mage had to be exceptional to stand out from the crowd, and even then there was no guarantee of prosperity.
        <br><br>
        Sorcerers were rewarded for training more wizards, which left little time, motivation and resources for deeper research.
        Eventually the population reached saturation in magical proficiency.
        There was little incentive to improve magical understanding, as this posed a threat to the system's very existence.
        <br><br>
        Fundamentally, the Open Magic Program favoured superficial instruction of basic magic with little to no teaching of the foundations.
        The quality of education also varied wildly from the prestigious school of magic in the capital,
        in contrast to those run by the guilds in the East, and vocational outposts in the outer provinces;
        a long hangover from the seminal decision to send journeymen out to enact the Emperor's will.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor lived long and comfortably enough to abdicate the throne to his son.
        Framed as an act of grace, the New Emperor took the throne only to find he had inherited a reign marked by shortcuts and complacency.
        The Empire was now fully 'magified' propped up by citizens who begrudgingly perpetuated archaic magic - a disaster waiting to happen.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~The Warlock's Wargame~</span><br>
        <i>A warlock is a magic-user whose power is granted by a higher being. It requires a sacrifice or deal, for an equivalent amount of power, and can be done by anyone.</i>
        <br><br>
        <i>The Chief Warlock</i> was an ardent follower of the religion of the Old Gods.
        Whilst the practice was technically outlawed centuries ago, the rationale behind the law was long forgotten and enforcement was lax.
        The warlocks' magical prowess were favourable enough for the state to overlook their cultish practices and permit their inclusion in the ministry.
        <br><br>
        Following a communion with his Patron, the Chief relayed an offer to the Emperor:
        Anyone may access a fraction of the power of the Old Gods for the simple price of 'acceptance'.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor was sceptical of the Chief's proposition, but also desperate for respite.
        His counter offer: restricing the offer only to members of the military.
        <br><br>
        And so, the laws against the Old Religion were subtly repealed.
        The warlocks got to work spreading the word of the Old Gods throughout the ranks of the army.
        <br><br>
        On the Northern front they began patronising soldiers one-by-one.
        Initially they were met with the same apprehension as the Emperor had displayed, but soon the results spoke for themselves.
        Soldiers who accepted the power of the Old God of War described it as a 'fire burning inside them'.
        A sense of strength, warmth, and belonging.
        <br><br>
        Other soldiers noticed the change in demeanour, piquing their interest in the cold and desolate trenches.
        But perhaps what was most telling sign was those who accepted the power always returned from skirmishes.
        Entire squadrons would be seemingly wiped out - only for the sole survivor to be a <i>Follower</i>.
        <br><br>
        It didn't take long for most of the Northern defenders to Follow. Those who didn't were quick to perish.
        <br><br>
        You see, the magic of the Old Religion draws its power from the people who feed it.
        Once the entire army was subject to the God of War they were unstoppable.
        Within weeks the Northern invaders were driven back to their homelands.
        <br><br>
        Word of the military turnaround reached the Emperor.
        Casting aside his reservations on the Old Religion, he commanded the army to push further North, exterminating his enemies along the way.
        The Emperor reveled in this newfound sense of control - one which he had never experienced before.
        <br><br>
        News of the Old Religion's rennaissance spread like wildfire.
        Riding the wave of euphoria, the Chief Warlock humbly requested another audience with the Emperor.
        This time to offer patronage to all the Empire's citizens.
        <br><br>
        Having not experienced any consequences from subjugating the army to the God of War, the Emperor gladly complied.
        The laws were changed once again, albeit publicly this time.
        <br><br>
        It wasn't long before the South was worshipping the God of Harvest for breaking the famine, and
        the merchants worshipping the God of Water for safe passage in the West Sea.
        Only the smiths and artisans of the Eastern Provinces continued to hold out against the Old Religion.
        <br><br>
        Their scepticism was born of fear of tainting the art and integrity of their work.
        This only intensified the rebellion in the region.
        Regardless, the Emperor had no reservations about forcing the East to Follow.
        He granted subsidies and concessions to craftsmen who converted and prioritised the export of their goods.
        Within the year the remaining rebels went out of business - Follow or perish.
        <br><br>
        With most of the Empire under the Religion's influence, productivity was booming and the gold rolling in.
        The Chief Warlock once again came to the Emperor with a proposition: to spread the Empire and the word of the Gods to the rest of the world.
        The price? The Emperor's personal 'acceptance' and sanctification in the Religion himself.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor felt an uneasy compulsion to accept.
        He suppressed the thought of losing all that had already been granted to him...
        <br><br>
        Years went by, the Empire had expanded its borders but the Religion spread to further horizons.
        On the other side of the world the Religion met its match - in other competing religions.
        <br><br>
        The population had atrophied to the point of being completely reliant on the Gods power in everyday life.
        All competing magical innovation from sorcerers and wizards was incabable of garnering the adoption to overcome the Religion.
        Although the Followers didn't seem to mind; faith was a small price to pay for the Religion's conveniences.
        It had had become the status quo, and the Empires armies were regularly shipped off to foreign lands to protect the Religious hegemony.
        <br><br>
        Gradually, the Religion's global ambitions began to demand greater patronage from the people.
        You see, the magic of the Religion draws its power from the people who feed it -
        and you can only surmise what happens when the people are powerless.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor saw what had become of his Empire. 
        Without the freedom to determine their own future, his citizens had become mindlessly enslaved to the Religion.
        He was merely a figurehead, speaking for the warlocks who truly ran the nation.
        But even the warlocks were losing their influence in their communions with their Patrons, a path which would only spell doom.
        <br><br>
        The Emperor lay his head in his hands and wept, as he understood why the Old Religion was outlawed so long ago.
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~Intermission~</span><br>
        The sorcerers are intensely and want to improve magic.
        The wizards are educated and want to spread magic.
        The warlocks are ambitious and want to control with magic.

        If left unchecked each faction will spell the doom of the empire, its citizens, itself or all of the above.
        The solution lies in keeping all three forever in a tug-of-war with each other.
        Each faction complements and counterbalances the others
        + Sorcerers innovate (counters stagnation and dominance)
        + Wizards evangalise (counters scepticism and deception)
        + Warlocks capitalise (counters slowness and complacency)

        Sorcery:
        Easier to build greenfields instead of fixing the problem at the source.
        First mover's disadvantage.
        A.k.A Space Race? Solar? Nuclear?

        Wizardry:
        e.g. Consumer electronics, outsourcing, mass marketing, firearms, crossbows, industrial revolution, the education system
        Easier to delegate the "what" instead of fixing the problem at the source.


        Warlock:
        e.g. AI, big Tech, social media, religion
        Loss of free will

        The Emperor's folly is that he doesn't understand magic and the interpolitics of his advisors. 
        He sits in an ivory tower and thinks one dimensionally that picking a single horse can win the race.
        Rather, it's only when the horses work together can they pull the carriage - and he needs to be the one in the drivers seat.
      </p>

        Allegory
        Invaders = Defence issues
        Pirates = Trade issues
        Revolts = Civil issues
        Famine = Industrial issues

        Wizard = Learned power, education and empowerment
        Warlock = Patronised power, deal with the devil. AI big tech
        Sorcerer = Innate power, science - privelege
        
        The solution is for them all to work together, not necessarily in harmony but in a balanced tug-of-war
        The sum of the parts is greater than it all. You can have a win-win-win situation.

        <br><br>
        Parallels between work and romance? Perhaps there's something instinctual that drives us to seek more.

        Acceping the status quo, and taking it for granted is like a union - a harmonious matrimony of both parties.

        Losing it is like a divorce, sometimes othertimes brutally

                They say people overestimate what they can accomplish in one year, but underestimate what they can do in ten.
        Finally I can say I have the data to truly agree.
