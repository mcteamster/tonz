                This is a post about justice. Statistics and AI vs the government. Fighting for the rights. Marraige equality. Sci-fi theme?

                Pop culture used to be about bad boys and sad girls. Now it's all about sad boys and bad girls.
                Maybe tomorrow's stars will be bipolar and genderfluid?
                It's moot to deliberate what's better, and I certainly don't intend to start a fight between Gen Y and Z.
                Admittedly, I was born straddling the fence and often find myself jumping from side to side.

                This is a tale about indecision, procrastination, inaction, and stubbornness.
                At the same time it's about drama, social change, and the fast times of young adulthood.
                It's one part science lecture, one part political commentary, and one part teen soap opera.
                It is everything and nothing all at once, a quantum superposition of thoughts.

                I'd describe myself as a radical centrist.
                Stoic devoid of emotion.
                Virtualize (emulate) social skills. Imitation, mockery
                The turing test.

                LGBT community is not a collective consiousness. United by differences, more of a coallation with a common goal

                Statistics
                Control theory

                Looming generations of boomers, who thanks to modern medicine, may outlive their savings and rely on their children.

                A pure numbers game, if those children have fewer children themselves, then they have more capacity to support their parents.

                Pro plebiscite from a data science perspective. Had the undesirable side effect of alienation. Would you rather not know? Deliberate ambiguity.
                $20 per taxpayer, a lobster - that's a steal. Statistic sampling is cheap, population sampling is expansive. $20 is a steal to know once and for all for certain!
                Perhaps one ady being bipolar-genderfluid will be the accepted norm.

                *Theme is about deliberate ambiguity. The climax and plot should be open to interpretation.

                Oh isn't it ironic that Pride is a deadly sin? Though all things considered I think that's a good thing.
