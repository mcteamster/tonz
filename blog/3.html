      <h2 class="subtitle">or the game theory of gender equity</h2>
      <p>March 2023</p>

        In modern dating, there's a fine line between chivalry and equality.
        <br><br>
        Long gone are the days where men are obliged to pay for everything.
        Although it's still commonplace to offer, it can come off anywhere from generously courteous, to offensively
        antiquated.
        <br><br>
        The rules are even less clear for women; should you accept? Or offer to split? Or pay for everything entirely?
        Every option comes intertwined with considerations about one's morals, financial circumstances, or just how much
        you even like the other person.
        <br><br>
        In Australia, the gender pay gap currently sits at 13.3%.
        This begs the question: should women be expected to pay an equal share on an unequal wage?
        <br><br>
        Here we explore strategies for tackling an abstraction of the above problem with the use of Game Theory.
        And of course, what kind of blog post would this be without a background story...
        <br><br>
        <span class="branch">~Date 1~</span><br>
        Alice and Bob met on [INSERT APP HERE], and are having their first date.

        Generalisations are never truly accurate, yet en-masse can they be powerful.
        In the absence of auditing everyone's individual financial situations (and the privacy issues that goes with
        that),
        splitting the macroeconomic difference is an efficient strategy for achieving long-term equality.

        But doing mental arithmetic is hard. This is why I've created Libra - a simple pay gap calculator with a simple
        UI.

        Libra is a vision of what Big FinTech could do to help tackle gender pay inequality.
        By all means, if you're reading, please take this stupidly simple idea and roll it into your product!

        Technology has great power to enact positive social change.
        By making it easy to pick responsible options, and normalising away stigma, we can help close the gap to zero.
