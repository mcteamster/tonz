            <p>August 2021</p>
            <p>
                Pop culture used to be about bad boys and sad girls. Now it's about sad boys and bad girls.
                Frankly, debating what's better is moot, and I'm not here to start a fight between Gen-Y and Gen-Z.
                I'll admit though that I do like both - I was born straddling the fence and often find myself jumping from side to side.
                <br><br>
                The following is an age old story of <y>boy</y> meets <x>girl</x> - an homage to the 2000's rom-com.
                You may also notice it contains a subtle science lesson, on top of a not-so-subtle intro to control theory
                in the style of a director's running commentary.
                <br><br>
                <span class="branch">~1~</span><br>
                Robin met Blake in the summer before 9th grade. 
                <x>She</x> was new to town, and had moved into the house next to <y>his</y>.
                An only child, <x>her</x> <x>father</x> had taken a job teaching freshman physics at the local university.
                <x>Her</x> <x>mother</x> had passed years earlier from <x>cervical</x> cancer, detected too late...
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> had gotten used to raising <x>herself</x>.
                A little shy, a bit of a recluse, yet wise beyond <x>her</x> years.
                Perhaps it was puberty, or finding <x>herself</x> alone in an unfamiliar place,
                which made her yearn for companionship in ways <x>she'd</x> never felt before. 
                Luckily for <x>her</x> Blake was nearby.
                <br><br>
                At a glance Blake was as typical a teen as <y>he</y> could be.
                Popular, sporty, and confident, yet with a kind of goofily adorable hometown charm.
                <y>He</y> welcomed Robin into <y>his</y> life in an instant without even a semblance of hesitation.
                <br><br>
                Such a seamless gesture by Blake meant the whole world to Robin.
                Every day they spent together that summer helped cleanse the misery of the years before.
                Soon they were inseparable, and Robin dreamed about what going to school with <y>him</y> and <y>his</y> friends would be like.
                Blake was <x>her</x> golden ticket to a normal life.
                <br><br>
                Yet as they rode the school bus on the first day back, sharing the music from <x>her</x> iPod,
                Robin couldn't help but notice the prying eyes pointing their way.
                "Maybe this is what it's like to be the new kid?" <x>she</x> thought to <x>herself</x> in denial.
                But the whispers only grew louder, and the rumours wilder as more kids got on the bus.
                <br><br>
                Boys are notoriously dumb at an early age - girls mature so much faster.
                Who knows what they might learn from observing young women instead of spending that time gawking and jeering?
                <br><br>               
                Robin felt <x>her</x> anxiety slowly seeping in. <x>She</x> definitely wasn't used to the small-town stares.
                She leant into <x>her</x> single earpiece to try and drown out the noise,
                awkwardly resting <x>her</x> head on Blake's shoulder in the process. 
                <y>He</y> was oblivious for a while, as though <y>he</y> were in a state of pre-game meditation.
                But soon Blake saw what was happening: how overwhelming the situation had become for <x>her</x>.
                <br><br>
                <y>He</y> sprung into action and waved over some of <y>his</y> friends who had just hopped on the bus.
                "Hey guys! This is my neighbour Robin!" <y>he</y> introduced effortlessly,
                "<x>She's</x> new here and like SUPER smart - <x>she'll</x> fit right in!"
                <br><br>
                And just like that, <x>her</x> nerves vanished and the doubt was gone.
                They exchanged pleasantries - the mood swiftly switching to a comforting calm. 
                <x>She</x> could not believe it. It was as if Blake's magic words had cast a spell on the entire room.
                <br><br>
                With a spring in <x>her</x> step that first day flew by.
                <x>She</x> dazzled the teachers with her wits, signed up for the science club and school band,
                and sat with the 'cool' kids at lunch. It was surreal. For the first time in Robin's life <x>SHE</x> was part of the in-crowd.
                <br><br>
                The ride home was the polar opposite of that morning. No longer at the centre of attention, 
                Robin beemed giddily with excitement in <x>her</x> seat. Adjacently, Blake was as cool and casual as always.
                In the blink of an eye they arrived at their stop, and began their walk home up the hill.
                <br><br>
                They walked and talked on the way to the top. Or more accurately Blake listened politely whilst Robin eagerly recounted <x>her</x> day.
                Blake paused at the peak and turned to remind <x>her</x>, "Woah Robin, slow down. Breathe!"
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> did. Processing for a moment before replying: "I just... had a really good day today."
                Honestly, this was an understatement. <x>She</x> had NEVER felt anything like this before in <x>her</x> life.
                <br><br>
                Then there in the heat of the moment <x>she</x> went in for a kiss...
                <br><br>
                And. It. Was. AWKWARD!
                <br><br>
                Between catching Blake off-guard mid-swerve, and the fact that <x>she'd</x> never kissed a <y>boy</y> before,
                it was really no surprise that <x>her</x> tongue ended up traversing from <y>his</y> top lip into <y>his</y> left nostril.
                Blake took a step back, visibly shook, as Robin looked into <y>his</y> eyes like a puppy who knows they've done something wrong -
                dreading what comes after the silence.
                <br><br>
                Blake broke the standoff with a chuckle and a smile, <y>his</y> hand wiping the wetness off <y>his</y> face.
                Perfectly on-brand <y>he</y> joked: "I suppose you haven't read any books on kissing hey?"
                <br><br>
                "I'm sorry," <x>she</x> responded meekly, "I mean can you even call <i>that</i> a kiss?"
                knowing full well it was more of a vigorous lick.
                <br><br>
                "Hey look, I don't keep score," Blake reassured <x>her</x> before adding: 
                "but maybe we should keep this between ourselves? You've been a really good friend to me this summer.
                I mean we wouldn't want anyone getting the wrong idea you know?"
                <br><br>
                Robin's heart sank a little - <x>she</x> really had no other option but to agree. 
                With <x>her</x> head screwed back on, <x>her</x> logical self began to bargain that hanging 
                out with Blake as just friends was still an overwhelmingly positive experience.
                <br><br>
                Nonetheless a million thoughts continued to bug <x>her</x> while walking down the street back home.
                Of course <x>she</x> knew Blake was well within <y>his</y> right to rebut <x>her</x>. 
                Sadly that didn't stop the pain. It was the sour sense of shame that Robin struggled to shake the most.
                <x>She</x> blamed only <x>herself</x> for confusing friendship with love...
                <br><br>

                <span class="branch">~2~</span><br>
                Blake and Robin stayed good friends over the coming years.
                Their school had a reputation for being one of the best in the district, despite the lack of funding,
                and they both played their part in upholding it.
                <br><br>
                Athletically, Blake's swim team made state finals three years running.
                Academically, Robin's science team, debating team, chess team, and band consistently made the podium every time.
                Although Blake was a pretty lousy student, and Robin didn't know how to swim, 
                it never stopped them from supporting each other at events religiously.
                <br><br>
                It's nice to have someone in your corner. Especially when they have your back win or lose, rain or shine.
                <br><br>
                Romantically, Blake had dated a few <y>girls</y> from other schools.
                They were mostly swimmers, but <y>he'd</y> usually realise that they didn't have much else in common at all.
                <br><br>
                Robin was low-key intimidated by the attractiveness of Blake's fit exes.
                <x>She</x> wasn't ugly by any means, but was convinced that <x>she</x> was under Blake's league.
                <y>He</y> picked up on that vibe and had simply accepted that <x>she</x> probably still harboured a lingering crush.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, in the midst of 12th grade, there were so many more things to worry about besides dating.
                Studying for exams every weekday, attending extracurriculars every weeknight, and keeping up appearances at parties every weekend.
                <br><br>
                Well at least that's what Robin thought until <i>THE NEW <z>GIRL</z></i> showed up...
                <br><br>
                Charlie was a mid-year transfer from the big city.
                Rumours instantly flooded the halls with crazy theories about why <z>she</z> had moved for final semester.
                Of course kids are cruel and most of them were something along the lines of expulsion, or corruption, or worse.
                <br><br>
                At first Robin sympathised [and Blake empathised] with <z>her</z>, flashing back to the first day of 9th grade.
                This notion was quickly cast aside when Charlie boldly heralded <z>her</z> own arrival to the entire caffeteria at recess:
                <br><br>
                "Listen up boys and girls! I've heard everything you've had to say about me and for the record not a single one of you are right!"
                <br><br>
                "No, I didn't get expelled!"
                <br><br>
                "No! I didn't f*ck a teacher!"
                <br><br>
                "And NO! my 'daddy' is not in jail!!!"
                <br><br>
                "Actually it's quite the opposite. See, he's the new goddamn governor of this state.
                And do you know what that means? It means he sends his <z>daughter</z> to the BEST F*CKING STATE SCHOOL there is!"
                <br><br>
                "Yeah thats right! You heard it right here, you're the best! 
                And all those preppy private school SH*TS can GO F*CK THEMSELVES!"
                <br><br>
                Such a display of brazen dominance was clearly a calculated Alpha move.
                Pure political diarrhoea but the audience sure lapped it up. 
                Charlie had instilled a strange mix of fear, spirit, and motivation in the school just when it was needed most. 
                <br><br>
                He asks her for tuition, is this love? or is he just useing her?
                New girl, kinda like her but better? They become friends/rivals healthy competition.
                BEST FRIEND'S GENDER IS ALWAYS OPPOSITE BLAKE
                YOU DONT KNOW YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
                <br><br>
                Why cant they just be friends? Study buddies? Society says it aint so.
                Is there a subtle racial undertone? Intentionally ambiguous where Robin came from before? Allude to her being a migrant, but keep it universal.
                Talk about special relativity, time dilation, twin paradox - in dumbed down terms.
                Talk about general relativity, how that 'solves' the twin paradox. Interstellar.
                <br><br>
                At a party [reference] he gets super drunk and hooks up with her best friend.
                At this point she is overtly hurt and reveals her emotions explicitly for the first time.
                Unbottles and drowns her sorrows from the liqor cabinet - crying sesh.
                <br><br>
                He starts hanging around more, with her best friend too. Creates a weird dynamic with a lot of sexual tension.
                Mental health starts going downhill, for both of them.
                They become the centre of gossip and attention. Being in the midst of drama is far worse than being on the sidelines.
                She alwasy hated the limelight.
                <br><br>
                Finals, grades start to go down. Stress. End of school.
                Doesnt look at atar, burns it and leaves it unknown - as well as her future.

                SCIENCE BIT #2  Optimality. Transient, steady-state, stimulus, damping. Stuff is stable, oh how things suddenly change. CHange is the only constant.
                Charlie is the stimulus - setting in motion lots of changes and the characters need to cope. The transient is animosity and rivalry, the steady state is friendship.
                <br><br>

                Rite of passage coast trip after school. Should be a time for celebration.
                All they feel is emptiness. Bubbles are empty inside.
                And one night it just happens, they sleep together. (Without the judgement and the shame of school?)
                <br><br>
                Robin loses virginity, pain in the nads after. Pain in the feels too, now what? Is that all I was looking for?. Assumes its normal but it get seems to get worse.
                Doesn't feel comfortable telling anyone, gets super crunk, almost dies. Saved by best friend.
                The pain is caused by heridetary cancer - early stage enough for treatment.
                People get super crunk, she almost dies (unsure if intentional or not - also ambiguous).
                Saved by her best friend.

                Finally Uni offers come out, she was in a mindset to leave town and start anew, but also applied to stay as a backup.
                He planned to stay, to take care of his siblings in the wake of his family's unfolding troubles.
                She chooses to stay for him, he feels guilty for holding her down, he can't bear to face it and chooses to go.
                <br><br>
                She and him talk, agree that it's gone too far and they go their separate ways.

                She spends the following years healing the scars, relarning how to love.
                He throws himself into a new life, running away from his demons.

                Years later they meet again, greeting each other as old friends.

                Will Literature about Bipolar Emotionally Unstable Genderfluid People be popular?
                I feel both Robin and Blake on different days.
                Names should be gender ambiguous, even make the grammar completely ambiguous and subject to assumptions. Use pronouns as much as possible.
                Javascript to re-render the story in other pronoun combinations.
                What if the roles were reversed? - This is the plot twist. 
                Read it again, the story may change, but the science behind it remains the same (RELATIVITY oooh)
                This is where the 'General Theory of Relatability' comes into play.
                The emotions you feel are universal and felt by all.
                The pain and heartbreak you feel along the way makes you stronger (if it doesnt kill you)
