            <p>August 2021</p>
            <p>
                Pop culture used to be about bad boys and sad girls. Now it's about sad boys and bad girls.
                Frankly, debating what's better is moot, and I'm not here to start a fight between Gen-Y and Gen-Z.
                I'll admit though that I do like both - I was born straddling the fence and often find myself jumping from side to side.
                <br><br>
                The following is an age old story of <y>boy</y> meets <x>girl</x> - an homage to the 2000's rom-com.
                You may also notice it contains a subtle science lesson, on top of a not-so-subtle intro to control theory
                in the style of a director's running commentary.
                <br><br>
                <span class="branch">~1~</span><br>
                Robin met Blake in the summer before 9th grade. 
                <x>She</x> was new to town, and had moved into the house next to <y>his</y>.
                An only child, <x>her</x> <x>father</x> had taken a job teaching freshman physics at the local university.
                <x>Her</x> <x>mother</x> had passed years earlier from <x>cervical</x> cancer, detected too late...
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> had gotten used to raising <x>herself</x>.
                A little shy, a bit of a recluse, yet wise beyond <x>her</x> years.
                Perhaps it was puberty, or finding <x>herself</x> alone in an unfamiliar place,
                which made her yearn for companionship in ways <x>she'd</x> never felt before. 
                Luckily for <x>her</x> Blake was nearby.
                <br><br>
                At a glance Blake was as typical a teen as <y>he</y> could be.
                Popular, sporty, and confident, yet with a kind of goofily adorable hometown charm.
                <y>He</y> welcomed Robin into <y>his</y> life in an instant without even a semblance of hesitation.
                <br><br>
                Such a seamless gesture by Blake meant the whole world to Robin.
                Every day they spent together that summer helped cleanse the misery of the years before.
                Soon they were inseparable, and Robin dreamed about what going to school with <y>him</y> and <y>his</y> friends would be like.
                Blake was <x>her</x> golden ticket to a normal life.
                <br><br>
                Yet as they rode the school bus on the first day back, sharing the music from <x>her</x> iPod,
                Robin couldn't help but notice the prying eyes pointing their way.
                "Maybe this is what it's like to be the new kid?" <x>she</x> thought to <x>herself</x> in denial.
                But the whispers only grew louder, and the rumours wilder as more kids got on the bus.
                <br><br>
                Boys are notoriously dumb at an early age - girls mature so much faster.
                Who knows what they might learn from observing young women instead of spending that time gawking and jeering?
                <br><br>               
                Robin felt <x>her</x> anxiety slowly seeping in. <x>She</x> definitely wasn't used to the small-town stares.
                She leant into <x>her</x> single earpiece to try and drown out the noise,
                awkwardly resting <x>her</x> head on Blake's shoulder in the process. 
                <y>He</y> was oblivious for a while, as though <y>he</y> were in a state of pre-game meditation.
                But soon Blake saw what was happening: how overwhelming the situation had become for <x>her</x>.
                <br><br>
                <y>He</y> sprung into action and waved over some of <y>his</y> friends who had just hopped on the bus.
                "Hey guys! This is my neighbour Robin!" <y>he</y> introduced effortlessly,
                "<x>She's</x> new here and like SUPER smart - <x>she'll</x> fit right in!"
                <br><br>
                And just like that, <x>her</x> nerves vanished and the doubt was gone.
                They exchanged pleasantries - the mood swiftly switching to a comforting calm. 
                <x>She</x> could not believe it. It was as if Blake's magic words had cast a spell on the entire room.
                <br><br>
                With a spring in <x>her</x> step that first day flew by.
                <x>She</x> dazzled the teachers with her wits, signed up for the science club and school band,
                and sat with the 'cool' kids at lunch. It was surreal. For the first time in Robin's life <x>SHE</x> was part of the in-crowd.
                <br><br>
                The ride home was the polar opposite of that morning. No longer at the centre of attention, 
                Robin beemed giddily with excitement in <x>her</x> seat. Adjacently, Blake was as cool and casual as always.
                In the blink of an eye they arrived at their stop, and began their walk home up the hill.
                <br><br>
                They walked and talked on the way to the top. Or more accurately Blake listened politely whilst Robin eagerly recounted <x>her</x> day.
                Blake paused at the peak and turned to remind <x>her</x>, "Woah Robin, slow down. Breathe!"
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> did. Processing for a moment before replying: "I just... had a really good day today."
                Honestly, this was an understatement. <x>She</x> had NEVER felt anything like this before in <x>her</x> life.
                <br><br>
                Then there in the heat of the moment <x>she</x> went in for a kiss...
                <br><br>
                And. It. Was. AWKWARD!
                <br><br>
                Between catching Blake off-guard mid-swerve, and the fact that <x>she'd</x> never kissed a <y>boy</y> before,
                it was really no surprise that <x>her</x> tongue ended up traversing from <y>his</y> top lip into <y>his</y> left nostril.
                Blake took a step back, visibly shook, as Robin looked into <y>his</y> eyes like a puppy who knows they've done something wrong -
                dreading what comes after the silence.
                <br><br>
                Blake broke the standoff with a chuckle and a smile, <y>his</y> hand wiping the wetness off <y>his</y> face.
                Perfectly on-brand <y>he</y> joked: "I suppose you haven't read any books on kissing hey?"
                <br><br>
                "I'm sorry," <x>she</x> responded meekly, "I mean can you even call <i>that</i> a kiss?"
                knowing full well it was more of a vigorous lick.
                <br><br>
                "Hey, look, I'm not keeping score," Blake reassured <x>her</x> before adding: 
                "but maybe we should keep this between ourselves? I mean you've been a really good friend to me this summer.
                We wouldn't want anyone getting the wrong idea you know?"
                <br><br>
                Robin's heart sank a little - <x>she</x> really had no other option but to agree. 
                With <x>her</x> head screwed back on, <x>her</x> logical self began to bargain that hanging 
                out with Blake as just friends was still an overwhelmingly positive experience.
                <br><br>
                Nonetheless a torrent of thoughts flooded <x>her</x> mind on the way down <x>her</x> street.
                Of course <x>she</x> knew Blake was well within <y>his</y> right to rebut <x>her</x>. 
                Sadly, that didn't stop the pain. It was a sour sense of shame that Robin struggled to shake the most.
                <x>She</x> blamed only <x>herself</x> for confusing friendship with love...

                <span class="branch">~2~</span><br>
                Blake and Robin stayed good friends over the coming years.
                Their school had a reputation for being one of the best in the district, despite the lack of funding,
                and they both played their part in upholding it.
                <br><br>
                Athletically, Blake's swim team made state finals three years running.
                Academically, Robin's science team, debating team, chess team, and band consistently made the podium every time.
                Although Blake was a pretty lousy student, and Robin didn't know how to swim, 
                it never stopped them from supporting each other at events religiously.
                <br><br>
                It's nice to have someone in your corner. Somebody to rely on. Especially when they have your back; rain or shine.
                <br><br>
                Romantically, Blake had dated a few <y>girls</y> from other schools.
                They were mostly swimmers, but <y>he'd</y> pretty quickly realise that was the extent of their similarities.
                <br><br>
                Robin was always low-key intimidated by the attractiveness of Blake's fit exes.
                <x>She</x> wasn't ugly by any means, but was convinced that <x>she</x> was under Blake's league.
                <y>He'd</y> picked up on that vibe and had simply accepted that <x>she</x> probably still harboured a lingering crush.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, in the midst of 12th grade, there were so many more things to worry about besides dating.
                Studying for exams every weekday, extracurriculars every weeknight, and the quintessential high-school parties every weekend.
                <br><br>
                Well at least that's what they thought until <i>THE NEW <z>GIRL</z></i> showed up...
                <br><br>
                Charlie was a mid-year transfer from the big city.
                The gossip train went into overdrive with theories about why <z>she'd</z> moved for final semester.
                Of course kids are cruel and jumped straight to expulsion, secudction, corruption, or worse.
                <br><br>
                At first Blake and Robin sympathised with <z>her</z>, flashing back to the first day of 9th grade.
                This notion was immediately shattered when Charlie stormed into the caffeteria at recess:
                <br><br>
                "Listen up boys and girls! I've heard everything you've had to say about me and for the record not a single one of you are right!"
                <br><br>
                "No, I didn't get expelled!"
                <br><br>
                "No! I didn't f*ck a teacher!"
                <br><br>
                "And NO! my 'daddy' is not in jail!!!"
                <br><br>
                "Actually it's quite the opposite. See, he's the new goddamn governor of this state.
                And do you know what that means? It means he needs to send his <z>daughter</z> to the BEST F*CKING STATE SCHOOL there is!"
                <br><br>
                "Yeah thats right! You heard it right here, you're the best! So why don't we start acting like it?
                This is my final semester and I sure as hell want to go out with a bang! 
                We're gonna take state champs for EVERYTHING you hear me!?
                And all those preppy private school SH*TS can GO F*CK THEMSELVES!"
                <br><br>
                Such a brazen display of dominance was clearly a calculated Alpha move.
                Pure political diarrhoea but the audience sure lapped it up.
                Charlie's pep talk installed the strangest mix of fear, motivation, and teen spirit - right when everyone needed it the most. 
                <br><br>
                Oh heck, did <z>she</z> have the bark AND the bite! 
                Charlie made the swim team, the science team, and of course the debate team, amongst many others.
                Both hot AND smart, <z>she</z> was the whole package - with the best bits of Blake and Robin combined.
                <br><br>
                Naturally, Blake and Robin ended up spending plenty of time with <z>her</z> separately.
                Interacting with Charlie was as easy as pie for Blake, and the way <z>she</z> flirted with <y>him</y> was a cherry on top.
                <y>He</y> could tell though that Robin didn't feel the same way.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps Robin was envious of <z>her</z> skills, or jealous of <z>her</z> getting close to <y>him</y>.
                Yet in Blake's mind <y>he</y> thought they were so similar. So Blake, being Blake, hatched a master plan:
                asking them both to tutor <y>him</y>... at the same time.
                <br><br>
                This was an absolutely terrible idea.
                <br><br>
                The three of them gathered in the library after school one Thursday;
                the topic: physics - theory of relativity. The mood was cold, and unusually quiet for Charlie.
                Light heartedly, Blake broke the ice, "You know I don't really get any of this stuff, but with two Einsteins helping me I know it'll be fine!"
                <br><br>
                The two tutors stared begrudgingly at Blake. After a moment Robin opened her textbook, "Okay. Let's see. What are we up to?"
                <br><br>
                "Time dilation." Charlie interjected.
                <br><br>
                "Right. Do you know the principle behind time dilation Blake?" Robin asked rhetorically, "Time passes slower for faster moving objects."
                <br><br>
                "It's like the saying: Time flies when you're having fun!" added Charlie, "an hour in the pool goes way faster than an hour of physics class yeah?"
                <br><br>
                "Um, yeah. Wait, no. I think... I get it?" mused Blake.
                <br><br>
                Robin [slightly irritated]: "Well it's not a simple as that. Time dilation only comes into play at astronomical speeds."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [inquisitively to Blake]: "Have you watched <i>Interstellar</i>?"
                <br><br>
                Robin [defensively]: "Yeah we saw it together last year."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [nonchalant]: "Cool, so time dilation is the reason why Matthew McConaughey's daughter is older than him after he leaves and comes back."
                <br><br>
                Blake [pondering]: "Yeah, makes sense."
                <br><br>
                Robin [grandstanding]: "But remember that velocity is relative. 
                In an astronaut's frame of reference the Earth could be leaving them as much they are leaving Earth.
                If you think about it this way then the astronaut could be away for years while time barely passes on Earth.
                But then how can you be older AND younger? This is what we call the Twin Paradox."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [going in for the kill]: "Although, it's not a 'real' paradox because there's a rational explanation.
                It's not just speed, forces like gravity affect time too."
                <br><br>
                Robin [scrambling]: "I'm gettting there! It's the astronaut who experiences huge acceleration so they're the one who ages slower. Got it Blake?"
                <br><br>
                Blake [confused]: "Yeah, nah. You lost me a while back."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [flirtatiously]: "Fast, strong attraction keeps you young baby ;)"
                <br><br>
                This was the last straw for Robin, it was insufferable. <x>She</x> packed up <x>her</x> things and left without a word.
                <br><br>
                Blake didn't see Robin at the swim meet on Friday. <x>She</x> ghosted all his messages too.
                Looking out <y>his</y> window <y>he</y> could see <x>she</x> was just at home, ignoring <y>him</y>.
                <br><br>
                They spoke, albeit briefly, at a friend's party on Saturday night.
                Blake hadn't expected <x>her</x> to come. <x>She</x> said she needed to de-stress.
                Blake had brought Charlie along too and <z>she</z> was totally in <z>her</z> element.
                They played drinking games with the boys whilst Robin stuck to being a wallflower.
                <br><br>
                The night descended quickly from there.
                Blake lost the game of <i>Kings Cup</i> and had to drink a disgusting concoction of kitchen condiments.
                Like the blind leading the blind, Charlie accompanied <y>him</y> to sober up.
                At this point <z>her</z> advances ceased to be subtle, and suddenly they were making out on the couch.
                <br><br>
                Mid-pash Blake pulled back, turned away, and vomited onto the carpet. 
                Charlie wiped the spew off <y>his</y> face, then resumed making out as if nothing had happened.
                None of the witnesses seems to care except for Robin, who out of heartbreak and disgust went to find something stronger.
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> laid her eyes on the liqor cabinet. 
                <x>She</x> pulled down a bottle of whatever <x>she</x> could reach, and took a hefty swig.
                <x>Her</x> eyes welled up as she sat with her back against the wall - the kiss burning into her mind.

                and soon the room was inundated by tears.

                SCIENCE BIT #2  Optimality. Transient, steady-state, stimulus, damping. Stuff is stable, oh how things suddenly change. CHange is the only constant.
                Charlie is the stimulus - setting in motion lots of changes and the characters need to cope. The transient is animosity and rivalry. Steady state is leaning to live with her.

                He starts hanging around more, with her best friend too. Creates a weird dynamic with a lot of sexual tension.
                Mental health starts going downhill, for both of them.
                They become the centre of gossip and attention. Being in the midst of drama is far worse than being on the sidelines.
                She alwasy hated the limelight.

                Rite of passage coast trip after school. Should be a time for celebration.
                All they feel is emptiness. Bubbles are empty inside.
                And one night it just happens, they sleep together. (Without the judgement and the shame of school?)

                YOU DONT KNOW YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
                Robin loses virginity, pain in the nads after. Pain in the feels too, now what? Is that all I was looking for?. Assumes its normal but it get seems to get worse.
                Doesn't feel comfortable telling anyone, gets super crunk, almost dies. Saved by best friend.
                The pain is caused by heridetary cancer - early stage enough for treatment.
                People get super crunk, she almost dies (unsure if intentional or not - also ambiguous).
                Saved by her best friend.

                Finally Uni offers come out, she was in a mindset to leave town and start anew, but also applied to stay as a backup.
                He planned to stay, to take care of his siblings in the wake of his family's unfolding troubles.
                She chooses to stay for him, he feels guilty for holding her down, he can't bear to face it and chooses to go.
                <br><br>
                She and him talk, agree that it's gone too far and they go their separate ways.

                SCIENCE BIT #3  Resonance, meta-stability, divergence. Things can be cyclically stable - in or out of sync (ying and yang). 
                Things can appear stable but hang on a knifes edge. Divergence occurs when there is no valid solution to the system cya later.

                She spends the following years healing the scars, relarning how to love.
                He throws himself into a new life, running away from his demons.
                <br><br>
                Years later they meet again, greeting each other as old friends.
                She is engaged to loving partner. He's living out his best bachelor years.
                They are both happy in their own way.
                <br><br>
                They look back upon their teenage years and reminisce that those were the days of their lives.
                The lessons they learnt when they were young definied their respective histories.
                It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.

                Will Literature about Bipolar Emotionally Unstable Genderfluid People be popular?
                I feel both Robin and Blake on different days.
                Names should be gender ambiguous, even make the grammar completely ambiguous and subject to assumptions. Use pronouns as much as possible.
                Javascript to re-render the story in other pronoun combinations.
                What if the roles were reversed? - This is the plot twist. 
                Read it again, the story may change, but the science behind it remains the same (RELATIVITY oooh)
                This is where the 'General Theory of Relatability' comes into play.
                The emotions you feel are universal and felt by all.
                The pain and heartbreak you feel along the way makes you stronger (if it doesnt kill you)

                Special Relativity - work that into the plot
                General Releativy resolves the paradoxes of special relativity in gravity a.k.a mutual attraction (what a beautiful theory!)
                Fortitude - courage to face adversity. To confront, to fight, what doesnt kill you
