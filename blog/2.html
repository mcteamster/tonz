            <p>August 2021</p>
            <p>
                Pop culture used to be about bad boys and sad girls. Now it's about sad boys and bad girls.
                Frankly, debating what's better is moot, and I'm not here to start a fight between Gen-Y and Gen-Z.
                I'll admit though that I do like both - I was born straddling the fence and often find myself jumping
                from side to side.
                <br><br>
                The following is an age old story of <y>boy</y> meets <x>girl</x> - an homage to the 2000's rom-com.
                Each chapter [1-3] is also accompanied by a short lesson in control theory [i-iii].
                These analyses contain no critical plot, and some readers may prefer to leave them the end, or skip them
                altogether.
                Think of it as director's running commentary; optional yet insightful.
                <br><br>
                <span class="branch">~1~</span><br>
                Robin met Blake in the summer before 9th grade.
                <x>She</x> was new to town, and had moved into the house next to <y>his</y>.
                An only child, <x>her</x>
                <x>dad</x> had taken a job teaching freshman physics at the local university.
                <x>Her</x>
                <x>mother</x> had passed years earlier from <x>cervical</x> cancer, detected too late...
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> had gotten used to raising <x>herself</x>.
                A little shy, a bit of a recluse, yet wise beyond <x>her</x> years.
                Perhaps it was puberty, or finding <x>herself</x> alone in an unfamiliar place,
                which made <x class="a">her</x> yearn for companionship in ways <x>she</x>'d never felt before.
                Luckily for <x class="a">her</x> Blake was nearby.
                <br><br>
                At a glance Blake was as typical a teen as <y>he</y> could be.
                Popular, sporty, and confident, yet with a kind of goofily adorable hometown charm.
                <y>He</y> welcomed Robin into <y>his</y> life without a moment of hesitation.
                <br><br>
                Such a seamless gesture by Blake meant the whole world to Robin.
                Every day they spent together that summer helped cleanse the misery of the years before.
                Soon they were inseparable, and Robin dreamed about what going to school with <y class="a">him</y> would
                be like.
                Blake was <x>her</x> golden ticket to a normal life.
                <br><br>
                Yet as they rode the school bus on the first day back, sharing the music from <x>her</x> iPod,
                Robin couldn't help but notice the prying eyes pointing their way.
                "Maybe this is what it's like to be the new kid?" <x>she</x> thought to <x>herself</x> in denial.
                But the whispers only grew louder, and the rumours wilder as more kids got on the bus.
                <br><br>
                Boys are notoriously dumb at an early age - girls mature so much faster.
                Who knows what they might learn from observing young women instead of spending that time gawking and
                jeering?
                <br><br>
                Robin felt <x>her</x> anxiety slowly seeping in. <x>She</x> definitely wasn't used to the small-town
                stares.
                <x>She</x> leant into <x>her</x> single earpiece to try and drown out the noise,
                awkwardly resting <x>her</x> head on Blake's shoulder in the process.
                <y>He</y> was oblivious for a while, as though <y>he</y> were in a state of pre-game meditation.
                But soon Blake saw what was happening: how overwhelming the situation had become for <x class="a">her
                </x>.
                <br><br>
                <y>He</y> sprung into action and waved over some of <y>his</y> friends who had just hopped on the bus.
                "Hey guys! This is my neighbour Robin!" <y>he</y> introduced effortlessly,
                "<x>She</x>'s new here and like SUPER smart - <x>she</x>'ll fit right in!"
                <br><br>
                And just like that, <x>her</x> nerves vanished and the doubt was gone.
                They exchanged pleasantries - the mood swiftly switching to a comforting calm.
                <x>She</x> could not believe it. It was as if Blake's magic words had cast a spell on the entire room.
                <br><br>
                With a spring in <x>her</x> step that first day flew by.
                <x>She</x> dazzled the teachers with <x>her</x> wits, signed up for the science club and school band,
                and sat with the 'cool' kids at lunch. It was surreal. For the first time in Robin's life <x>SHE</x> was
                part of the in-crowd.
                <br><br>
                The ride home was the polar opposite of that morning. No longer at the centre of attention,
                Robin beemed giddily with excitement in <x>her</x> seat. Adjacently, Blake was as cool and casual as
                always.
                In the blink of an eye they arrived at their stop, and began their walk home up the hill.
                <br><br>
                They walked and talked on their way to the top. Or more accurately Blake listened politely whilst Robin
                eagerly recounted <x>her</x> day.
                Blake paused at the peak and turned to remind <x class="a">her</x>, "Woah Robin, slow down. Breathe!"
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> did. Processing for a moment before replying: "I just... had a really good day today."
                Honestly, this was an understatement. <x>She</x> had NEVER felt anything like this before in <x>her</x>
                life.
                <br><br>
                Then there in the heat of the moment <x>she</x> went in for the kiss...
                <br><br>
                And. It. Was. AWKWARD!
                <br><br>
                Between catching Blake off-guard mid-swerve, and the fact that <x>she</x>'d never kissed a <y>boy</y>
                before,
                it was really no surprise that <x>her</x> tongue ended up traversing from
                <y>his</y> top lip into <y>his</y> left nostril.
                Blake took a step back, visibly shook, as Robin looked into <y>his</y> eyes like a puppy who knows
                they've done something wrong -
                dreading what comes after the silence.
                <br><br>
                Blake broke the standoff with a chuckle and a smile, <y>his</y> hand wiping the wetness off <y>his</y>
                face.
                Perfectly on-brand <y>he</y> joked: "I suppose you haven't read any books on kissing hey?"
                <br><br>
                "I'm sorry," <x>she</x> responded meekly, "I mean can you even call <i>that</i> a kiss?"
                knowing full well it was more of a vigorous lick.
                <br><br>
                "Hey, look, I'm not keeping score," Blake reassured <x class="a">her</x> before adding:
                "but maybe we should keep this between ourselves? I mean you've been a really good friend to me this
                summer.
                We wouldn't want anyone getting the wrong idea you know?"
                <br><br>
                Robin's heart sank a little - <x>she</x> really had no other option but to agree.
                With <x>her</x> head screwed back on, <x>her</x> logical self began to bargain that hanging
                out with Blake as just friends would still be an overall positive experience.
                <br><br>
                Nonetheless a torrent of thoughts flooded <x>her</x> mind on the way down <x>her</x> street.
                Of course <x>she</x> knew Blake was well within <y>his</y> right to rebut <x class="a">her</x>.
                Sadly, that didn't stop the pain. There was a sour sense of shame that Robin struggled to shake.
                <x>She</x> only blamed <x>herself</x> for confusing friendship with love...

                Blake and Robin stayed good friends over the coming years.
                Their school had a reputation for being one of the best in the district, despite the lack of funding,
                and they both played their part in upholding it.
                <br><br>
                Athletically, Blake's swim team made state finals three years running.
                Academically, Robin's science team, debating team, chess team, and band consistently made the podium
                every time.
                Although Blake was a pretty lousy student, and Robin didn't know how to swim,
                it never stopped them from supporting each other at events religiously.
                <br><br>
                It's nice to have someone in your corner. Somebody to rely on. Especially when they have your back; rain
                or shine.
                <br><br>
                Romantically, Blake had dated a few <y>girls</y> from other schools.
                They were mostly swimmers too, but that's where their similarities would end.
                <br><br>
                Robin was always low-key intimidated by the attractiveness of Blake's fit exes.
                <x>She</x> wasn't ugly by any means, but remained convinced that <x>she</x> was under Blake's league.
                <y>He</y>'d picked up on that vibe and had simply accepted that <x>she</x> probably still harboured a
                lingering crush.
                <br><br>
                Regardless, in the midst of 12th grade, there were so many more things to worry about besides dating.
                Studying for exams every weekday, extracurriculars every weeknight, and the quintessential high-school
                parties every weekend.
                <br><br>
                Well at least that's what they thought until <i>THE NEW <z>GIRL</z></i> showed up...
                <br><br>
                Charlie was a mid-year transfer from the big city.
                The gossip train went into overdrive with theories about why <z>she</z>'d moved for final semester.
                Of course kids are cruel and jumped straight to expulsion, seduction, corruption, or worse.
                <br><br>
                At first Blake and Robin sympathised with <z class="a">her</z>, flashing back to the first day of 9th
                grade.
                This notion was immediately shattered when Charlie stormed into the caffeteria at recess:
                <br><br>
                "Listen up boys and girls! I've heard everything you've had to say about me and for the record not a
                single one of you are right!"
                <br><br>
                "No, I didn't get expelled!"
                <br><br>
                "No! I didn't f*ck a teacher!"
                <br><br>
                "And NO! my 'daddy' is not in jail!!!"
                <br><br>
                "Actually it's quite the opposite. See, he's the new goddamn governor of this state.
                And do you know what that means? It means he needs to send his <z>daughter</z> to the BEST F*CKING STATE
                SCHOOL there is!"
                <br><br>
                "Yeah thats right! You heard it right here, you're the best! So why don't we start acting like it?
                This is MY final semester and I sure as hell am not here to f*ck around!
                We're gonna take state champs for EVERYTHING you hear me!?"
                <br><br>
                "Who's with me?? Yeah. Yeah! YEAH!"
                <br><br>
                "THAT'S MORE LIKE IT! Let's show 'em what we've got!
                And all those preppy private school SH*TS can GO F*CK THEMSELVES!"
                <br><br>
                Such a brazen display of dominance was clearly a calculated Alpha move.
                Pure political diarrhoea but the audience sure lapped it up.
                Charlie's pep talk installed the strangest mix of fear, motivation, and teen spirit - right when
                everyone needed it the most.
                <br><br>
                Oh heck, did <z>she</z> have the bark AND the bite!
                Charlie made the swim team, the science team, and of course the debate team, amongst many others.
                Both hot AND smart, <z>she</z> was the whole package - the best parts of Blake and Robin combined.
                <br><br>
                Naturally, Blake and Robin ended up spending plenty of time with <z class="a">her</z>.
                Interacting with Charlie was as easy as pie for Blake, and the way <z>she</z> flirted with <y class="a">
                    him</y>
                was a cherry on top.
                <y>He</y> could tell though that Robin didn't feel the same way.
                <br><br>
                Perhaps Robin was envious of <z>her</z> skills, or jealous of <z class="a">her</z> getting close to <y
                    class="a">him</y>.
                Yet in Blake's mind <y>he</y> thought they were so similar. So Blake, being Blake, hatched a master
                plan:
                asking them both to tutor <y class="a">him</y>... at the same time.
                <br><br>
                This was an absolutely terrible idea.
                <br><br>
                The three of them gathered in the library after school one Thursday;
                the topic: physics - theory of relativity. The mood was cold, and unusually quiet for Charlie.
                Light heartedly, Blake broke the ice, "You know I don't really get any of this stuff, but with two
                Einsteins helping me I know it'll be fine!"
                <br><br>
                The two tutors stared begrudgingly at Blake. After a moment Robin opened <x>her</x> textbook, "Okay.
                Let's see.
                What are we up to?"
                <br><br>
                "Time dilation." Charlie interjected.
                <br><br>
                "Right. Do you know the principle behind time dilation Blake?" Robin asked rhetorically, "Time passes
                slower for faster moving objects."
                <br><br>
                "It's like the saying: Time flies when you're having fun!" added Charlie, "an hour in the pool goes way
                faster than an hour of physics class yeah?"
                <br><br>
                "Um, yeah. Wait, no. I think... I get it?" mused Blake.
                <br><br>
                Robin [slightly irritated]: "Well it's not a simple as that. Time dilation only comes into play at
                astronomical speeds."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [inquisitively to Blake]: "Have you watched <i>Interstellar</i>?"
                <br><br>
                Robin [defensively]: "Yeah we saw it together last year."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [nonchalant]: "Cool, so time dilation is the reason why Matthew McConaughey's daughter is older
                than him after he leaves and comes back."
                <br><br>
                Blake [pondering]: "Ah yeah, makes sense."
                <br><br>
                Robin [grandstanding]: "But remember that velocity is relative.
                In an astronaut's frame of reference the Earth could be leaving them as much they are leaving Earth.
                If you think about it this way then the astronaut could go away for years while time barely passes on
                Earth.
                But then how can you be older AND younger? This is what we call the Twin Paradox."
                <br><br>
                Charlie [going in for the kill]: "Although, it's not a 'real' paradox because there's a rational
                explanation.
                It's not just speed, forces like gravity affect time too."
                <br><br>
                Robin [scrambling]: "I'm gettting there! So it's the astronaut who experiences huge acceleration so
                they're
                the one who ages slower. Got it Blake?"
                <br><br>
                Blake [confused]: "Yeah. Nah. You lost me a while back. Please dumb it down for me?"
                <br><br>
                Charlie [flirtatiously]: "Fast, strong attraction keeps you young baby ;)"
                <br><br>
                This was the last straw for Robin. It was insufferable. <x>She</x> packed up <x>her</x> things and left
                without a word.
                <br><br>
                Blake didn't see Robin at the swim meet on Friday. <x>She</x> ghosted all <y>his</y> messages too.
                Looking out <y>his</y> window <y>he</y> could see <x>she</x> was just at home, ignoring <y class="a">him
                </y>.
                <br><br>
                They spoke, albeit briefly, at a friend's party on Saturday night.
                Blake hadn't expected <x class="a">her</x> to come. <x>She</x> said <x>she</x> needed to de-stress.
                Blake had brought Charlie along too and <z>she</z> was totally in <z>her</z> element.
                They played drinking games with the boys whilst Robin stuck to being a wallflower.
                <br><br>
                The night descended quickly from there.
                Blake lost the game of <i>Kings Cup</i> and had to drink a disgusting concoction of kitchen condiments.
                Like the blind leading the blind, Charlie accompanied <y class="a">him</y> to sober up.
                At this point <z>her</z> advances ceased to be subtle, and suddenly they were making out on the couch.
                <br><br>
                Mid-pash Blake pulled back, turned away, and vomited onto the carpet.
                Charlie wiped the spew off <y>his</y> face, then resumed making out as if nothing had happened.
                None of the witnesses seems to care except for Robin, who out of heartbreak and disgust went to find
                something stronger.
                <br><br>
                <x>She</x> laid <x>her</x> eyes on the liquor cabinet.
                <x>She</x> pulled down a bottle of whatever <x>she</x> could reach, and took a hefty swig.
                <x>Her</x> eyes welled up as <x>she</x> sat with <x>her</x> back against the wall - drinking to forget
                the kiss that
                was burning into <x>her</x> mind.
                <br><br>
                It seemed <x>her</x> cries were a beacon for others who also sought to drown their troubles.
                The floodgates were open and one-by-one sad, stressed-out teens toppled like dominoes around <x>her</x>.
                And that was last thing Robin remembered; the sulking symphony of souls singing <x>her</x> to sleep...
                <br><br>

                SCIENCE BIT #2 Optimality. Transient, steady-state, stimulus, damping. Stuff is stable, oh how things
                suddenly change. CHange is the only constant.
                Charlie is the stimulus - setting in motion lots of changes and the characters need to cope. The
                transient is animosity and rivalry. Steady state is leaning to live with her.
                <br><br>
                <span class="branch">~3~</span><br>
                Whilst the news of Charlie and Blake's hookup spread like wildfire, 
                other stories from the party didn't quite make the headlines.
                It took a few days for Charlie to find out what had apparently happened to Robin
                and <z>she</z> spread the news to Blake.
                <br><br>
                Blake dropped everything to support Robin, incessantly apologising for not being there sooner.
                Robin, withdrawn back into <x>her</x> shell, insisted that <x>she</x> was OK and didn't want <y>his</y> pity.
                Blake didn't know what to say. <y>He</y> had no cards to play.
                The hookup was a catalyst for this whole ordeal but <y>he</y> couldn't turn back time.
                <br><br>
                "Charlie was the one that told me, you know?" Blake tried to console. 
                "<z>She</z>'s worried about you too."
                <br><br>
                "Do you honestly believe that? It's always theatrics with <z class="a">her</z>," sobbed Robin.
                <br><br>
                "<z>She</z> really is quite a lot like you," replied Blake, as if that was meant to make <x>her</x> feel better.
                <br><br>
                "I'M LIKE ME! But you don't love ME at all!" <x>she</x> burst.
                <br><br>
                "I do! But... just in a different way?" Blake added before shutting up, conceding defeat, and seeing <y>himself</y> out...
                <br><br>
                The rest of the school year dragged on slowly - time does not fly when you're not having fun.
                But true to <z>her</z> word as ever Charlie did manage to lead <z>her</z> teams to at least some trophies.
                <br><br>
                From Charlies perspective she tries to mediate and show compassion. Sorta guilty for what she did.
                Deep down Charlie only acts this way as a defence mechanism. Daddy issues?
                They become the centre of gossip and attention. Being in the midst of drama is far worse than being on
                the sidelines.
                She alwasy hated the limelight.
                Rite of passage coast trip after school. Should be a time for celebration.
                All they feel is emptiness. Bubbles are empty inside.
                And one night it just happens, they sleep together. (Without the judgement and the shame of school?)

                YOU DONT KNOW YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL
                Robin loses virginity, pain in the nads after. Pain in the feels too, now what? Is that all I was
                looking for?. Assumes its normal but it get seems to get worse. Is it normal to bleed? - not that much...
                Doesn't feel comfortable telling anyone, gets super crunk, almost dies. Saved by best friend.
                The pain is caused by heridetary cancer - early stage enough for treatment.
                People get super crunk, she almost dies (unsure if intentional or not - also ambiguous).
                Saved by her best friend.

                <br><br>
                Finally Uni offers come out, she was in a mindset to leave town and start anew, but also applied to stay
                as a backup.
                He planned to stay, to take care of his siblings in the wake of his family's unfolding troubles.
                She chooses to stay for him, he feels guilty for holding her down, he can't bear to face it and chooses
                to go.
                <br><br>
                She and him talk, agree that it's gone too far and they go their separate ways.

                She spends the following years healing the scars, relarning how to love.
                He throws himself into a new life, running away from his demons.
                <br><br>
                Years later they meet again, greeting each other as old friends.
                She is engaged to loving partner. He's living out his best bachelor years.
                They are both happy in their own way.
                <br><br>
                They look back upon their teenage years and reminisce that those were the days of their lives.
                The lessons they learnt when they were young definied their respective histories.
                It is better to have loved and lost than to have never loved at all.

                Will Literature about Bipolar Emotionally Unstable Genderfluid People be popular?
                I feel both Robin and Blake on different days.
                Names should be gender ambiguous, even make the grammar completely ambiguous and subject to assumptions.
                Use pronouns as much as possible.

                Read it again, the story may change, but the science behind it remains the same (RELATIVITY oooh)
                This is where the 'General Theory of Relatability' comes into play.
                The emotions you feel are universal and felt by all.
                The pain and heartbreak you feel along the way makes you stronger (if it doesnt kill you)
